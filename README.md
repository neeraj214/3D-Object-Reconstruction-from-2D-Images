# 3D-Object-Reconstruction-from-2D-Images
A single-image 3D reconstruction system built using deep learning techniques. The model predicts depth information from 2D RGB images and converts it into a 3D point cloud. Efficient preprocessing and feature extraction improve reconstruction quality. Designed for research and educational use in computer vision.
